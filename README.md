# Testify Environment

The Testify goal is to help developers learn about software testing in practice. We recommend using the platform along with Mauricio Aniche's book _Effective Software Testing: A Developer's Guide_, which is the base for the exercises.

## Environments

This repo stores the docker environments that run tests.
